# AdventOfCode

Hey, this is my repo where I hold all my solutions for [Advent of Code's](https://adventofcode.com/).

## 2021

[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is the first year of the Advent of Code series that I participated
while it was running.

## 2015 - 2020

These are series I'm planning to do during the current year, as I Didn't participate in them.

## Template

This project is based on the [AoCHelper Template](https://github.com/eduherminio/AdventOfCode.Template).
